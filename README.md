**Improving machining efficiency by identifying and eliminating non-machinable region with the help of K-means clustering**  
*(Course Project | Computer graphics and product modelling, Advisor: Prof. S. Pandey, IIT Bombay) (Jul’20-Dec’20)*  
• Generated Bezier bi-cubic surface using MATLAB code and performed feature engineering to extract the key features for machining  
• Analyzed the tool-surface interference and trained the K-means clustering algorithm to locate and merge the non-machinable areas
